The lines contain the data of each point. 
For each point, the line contains the following data:

	i x y d S O C R

Where
	i = vertex number
	x = x coordinate
	y = y coordinate
	d = service duration or visiting time
	S = profit of the location
    O = opening of time window (earliest time for start of service)
	C = closing of time window (latest time for start of service)
    R = Resource requirements (number of vehicles required to collect the profit)
* REMARKS *
	- The first point (index 0) is the depot.
	- The Euclidean distance is used and rounded down to the first decimal.
